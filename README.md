TwitterFavouriteSearchesApp
===========================

A simple Android App to store some Twitter searches

This is an example from Dietel's Android for Programmers book. It's chapter five's example app.

This chapter focuses on;
  * ScrollView
  * SharedPreferences
  * Intents
  * LayoutInflator
  * AlertDialog
  * AndroidManifest.xml

Feel free to improve on it.

This is is really a great book, each chapter focuses on specific areas and you develop an app in each chapter.
